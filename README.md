# 2048 WEB

This is the repository container information about a project I completed. The post describes building an optimised engine for 2048 along with an expectimax algorithm that is demoed playing the game in the browser. The game engine was build in rust and compile to WebAssembly allowing complex AIs that consider a large number of game states to be run in the browser.
